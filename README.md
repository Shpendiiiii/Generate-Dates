# Generate-Dates
A simple bash script that generates dates.

More specifically: say you need to generate only the working days of a month and put them in an excel sheet. Just type in the year, the month, and the days that were off, e.g.: 3 4 6 11 12 18 19 20. And the output will be of the text form with the dates in format DD/MM/YYYY.

The text file will generate in the same folder as of the script. 

This script can be more advanced by checking the integrity of the user input.
